# What is ADMETE?
ADMETE is a contract from the US Air Force that stands for Assured Digital Microelectronics Education & Training Ecosystem and the lab shares the same name. The contract expands the ongoing research and development of innovative, assured and trusted microelectronics technologies being conducted at Wright State. It also seeks to develop a pipeline of trained undergraduate engineering students with the skills to design and develop digital microelectronic devices and systems. In this lab we use systems designed by LPKF to manufacture and process printed circuit boards (PCBs).

# Guides
For the purposes of guides, I will be refrencing the [Yampad](https://github.com/mattdibi/yampad) which we have created many times before and we are confident in our production process of, as an example device. These guides will also assume a base level understanding of navigating Github, if you need help understanding [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world), click here.
