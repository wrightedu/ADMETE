# What is ADMETE?

ADMETE is a contract from the US Air Force that stands for Assured Digital Microelectronics Education & Training Ecosystem and the lab shares the same name. The contract expands the ongoing research and development of innovative, assured and trusted microelectronics technologies being conducted at Wright State. It also seeks to develop a pipeline of trained undergraduate engineering students with the skills to design and develop digital microelectronic devices and systems. In this lab we use systems designed by LPKF to manufacture and process printed circuit boards (PCBs).

# What is LPKF
LPKF (Leiterplatten-Kopierfrasen) is a company that produces lasers and electronics for printed circuit board technology. The company is based in Garbsen, Germany. 


# What resources are there to help us learn about it?
The manual is a good place to gain information about how to use an LPKF machine. Documentation for the small machines (E44) can be found [here](https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.973536.1586243173!/LPKF_E44_guide.pdf).

# Getting Started
The very first step of any production process is design. There are many different way's in that we can design boards in this lab. The computer assisted design (CAD) software that we use in this lab is know as *KiCAD*. In KiCad, you can use various different tools to design or tweak your circuit as seen below.

Rather than designing the boards yourself from scratch, you can also find many of the files necessary to create a board online. This is primarily what we have been doing in this lab, but in the future we plan to create our own in house designs as well.

# GitHub
For the purposes of this tutorial, I will be refrencing the [Yampad](https://github.com/mattdibi/yampad) which we have created many times before and we are confident in our production process of. This guide will also assume a base level understanding of navigating Github, if you need help understanding github, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
