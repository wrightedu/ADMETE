# What is ADMETE?

ADMETE is a contract from the US Air Force that stands for Assured Digital Microelectronics Education & Training Ecosystem and the lab shares the same name. The contract expands the ongoing research and development of innovative, assured and trusted microelectronics technologies being conducted at Wright State. It also seeks to develop a pipeline of trained undergraduate engineering students with the skills to design and develop digital microelectronic devices and systems. In this lab we use systems designed by LPKF to manufacture and process printed circuit boards (PCBs).

# What is LPKF
LPKF (Leiterplatten-Kopierfrasen) is a company that produces lasers and electronics for printed circuit board technology. The company is based in Garbsen, Germany. 


# What resources are there to help us learn about it?
The manual is a good place to gain information about how to use an LPKF machine. Documentation for the small machines (E44) can be found [here](https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.973536.1586243173!/LPKF_E44_guide.pdf).
