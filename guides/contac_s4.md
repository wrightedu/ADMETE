## Safety

Please be aware of the Materials Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals used in the process.  They should be posted on the table with the machine.

* Proper chemical resistant gloves are required when using the Contac S4 machine
* Safety glasses are required  when using the Contac S4 machine

## Pre-Requisites

* The Contac S4 is used to plate the insides of the board's drilled vias with copper so that they create a connection between traces on the top of the board and traces on the bottom of the board.

## Power On

* The power switch is located on the right side of the machine.
* Allow the machine to warm up for ***15 minutes*** on power on.

## Check Baths

* Ensure all baths are filled to the required levels. Top off with chemicals (or inform a trained staff member) if necessary:

  * Bath 1 takes cleaner 110
  * Bath 2 takes cleaner 210
  * Bath 3 takes activator 310
  * Bath 4 takes via cleaner
  * Bath 5 takes copper plater 400
  * Bath 6 takes tin plater (not used in this guide)

## Select Profile

* On the touchscreen interface, push the menu icon in the upper left corner
* Select "Profiles"
* Select "Copper Plating Profile"

## Bath 1

* Mount the board in the PCB handle located on the left side of the machine
  * Insert the long side into the clamps and tighten with an Allen wrench
* Rinse the board with tap water
* Take the lid off bath 1
* Place the board into bath 1 and press play

## Bath 2

* Once phase 1 is complete, remove the board from bath 1 and rinse it with tap water
* Place the board into bath 2 and press play

## Bath 3

* Once phase 2 is complete, remove the board from bath 2 and rinse it with tap water
* Dry the board with a heat gun
  * Hit the board on a hard surface while drying to ensure no air bubbles are trapped inside the vias
* Place the board into bath 3 and press play

## Bath 4

* Once bath 3 is complete, lift the board out of the bath and scrape ink off the surface back into the bath
* Transfer to a tub and scrape off any remaining ink
  *  We want ink to remain inside the vias and nowhere else because the copper will get deposited on the ink
* Dry the board and then place into bath 4 and press play

*** The quality of the copper plating depends on how dry the ink is, so ensure the board is as dry as possible before starting bath 4***

## Bath 5

* Once bath 4 is complete, remove the board
* Dry the board with a heat gun
  * Hit the board on a hard surface while drying to ensure no air bubbles are trapped inside the vias
  * *Again, the quality of the plating will depend on how dry the insides of the vias are*
* Gently wipe the surface with a moist towel to remove as much black ink as possible
  * Do not press into the holes on the board; we want the dry black ink to remain in the holes
* Place the board into bath 5 and press play
  * **Halfway through the two hour plating process the Contac will pause so you can rotate the board 180 degrees and press play again**

## Process Complete

* Once bath 5 is finished, remove the board
* Rinse with tap water and dry with a heat gun
* The via plating process is now complete
* Bath 6 is used for tin plating which is not covered in this guide
