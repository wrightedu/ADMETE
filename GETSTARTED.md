# Getting Started
The very first step of any production process is design. There are many different way's in that we can design boards in this lab. The computer assisted design (CAD) software that we use in this lab is know as *KiCAD*. In KiCad, you can use various different tools to design or tweak your circuit as seen below. While KiCad is installed on the lab computers, you should be creating your projects elsewhere and the computers in lab should only be used for CircuitPro with the gerber files you create on your own system. I go into further detail about gerber files and CircuitPro in the *KiCAD* and *CircuitPro* guides.

Rather than designing the boards yourself from scratch, you can also find many of the files necessary to create a board online. This is primarily what we have been doing in this lab, but in the future we plan to create our own in house designs as well.

# First Steps
Throughout this entire process, one of the key points is to use the computer wizards. These wizards simplify the entire process and give step by step instuctions of every step of the production process and also prompts for safety checks and procedure checks to make sure the operation is proceeding smoothly.
