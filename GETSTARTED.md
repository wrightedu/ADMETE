# Getting Started
The very first step of any production process is design. There are many different way's in that we can design boards in this lab. The computer assisted design (CAD) software that we use in this lab is know as *KiCAD*. In KiCad, you can use various different tools to design or tweak your circuit as seen below.

Rather than designing the boards yourself from scratch, you can also find many of the files necessary to create a board online. This is primarily what we have been doing in this lab, but in the future we plan to create our own in house designs as well.
